Project : [Password-Manager]
This is a simple Password Manager built with Python and Tkinter, offering core features like adding, searching, deleting, and generating passwords. 
It stores user credentials securely in a JSON file and includes a random password generator for creating strong passwords.
With a clean GUI, it serves as a lightweight alternative to tools like Google Password Manager, ideal for managing passwords locally.

Features I Added:
1. if i try to <add> the website which is already exist on the passwordBook then ask-> to change the password or not
2. if i <search> for the website and its exist then its password get copy on my clipboard
3. resolves <JSONDecodeError> , the error comes when passwordBook exist but empty
4. adding a delete button, to delete past saved passwords

Limitations:
1. we can't add password for the same website with 2 different emails.
